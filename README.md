# ðŸ§  Occupational Migraine Monitor

A data-driven project that analyzes and predicts the likelihood of experiencing sleep disorders (used here as a proxy for migraines/headaches) based on a person's occupation and lifestyle factors.


##  Project Overview

Work-related stress and lifestyle differences can significantly impact sleep health and migraine frequency. This project uses machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify which occupations are more prone to sleep disorders, helping organizations and individuals better understand occupational health risks.



## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Filename:** `Updated_Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`

**Key Features:**

- **Demographics:** Gender, Age, Occupation  
- **Lifestyle Habits:** Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Daily Steps
